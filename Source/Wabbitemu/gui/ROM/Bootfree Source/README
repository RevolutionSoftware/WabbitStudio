BootFree -- 100% Free of Boots since 2006!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 BootFree is a free software implementation of a portion of the "boot
 code" of the TI-73, TI-83 Plus, TI-83 Plus Silver Edition, TI-84
 Plus, and TI-84 Plus Silver Edition graphing calculators.  It
 represents the portion of the calculator's built-in software which
 cannot be upgraded, and hence the portion of the software which is
 not readily available from TI.  Combined with one of TI's OS
 upgrades, it forms a mostly-complete ROM image which can be used to
 emulate the calculator.

 BootFree is free software, and may be distributed freely in any
 medium provided its copyright and permission notices are preserved.
 Unlike the official boot code, it may thus be distributed along with
 a calculator emulator, or along with a third-party operating system,
 provided the other program's license permits this.

 Please note, however, that you may NOT distribute a ROM image
 composed of BootFree and an official TI operating system, as this is
 a violation of TI's copyright.  Such ROM images may only be created
 for personal use.

 This version of BootFree has been modified specifically to work with
 Wabbitemu. The goal is to allow you to create ROM version with a
 click of a couple buttons using BootFree and an OS downloaded from
 TI.


Assembling
~~~~~~~~~~

 This version of the source has been modified to work with SPASM.
 Originally BootFree was assembled with either zmasm or tpasm. To
 assemble, simply run the included batch file makespasm. spasm.exe
 must be found in PATH.

Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 BootFree aims for compatibility with the versions of the boot code
 that I personally have access to: TI-73 boot 1.3005, TI-83+ boot 1.00
 and 1.01, TI-83+ SE boot 1.00, and TI-84+/84+ SE boot 1.00 and 1.02.

 By "compatibility" I mean that calling the provided library routines
 via the B_CALL table with the same set of inputs should produce the
 same set of outputs as would be obtained by calling the official boot
 code's library routines in the same manner.  As much as possible I
 have tried to determine how the library routine is used by other
 parts of the boot code and OS, and thus isolate the intended outputs.

 I have not, however, attempted to match the unintended outputs of the
 official routines.  I have obviously tried to ensure that the
 registers and RAM areas altered by my routines are a subset of those
 altered by the official ones.  But, for example, my use of private
 sections of the bootTemp area should not be expected to match TI's.

 BootFree reports a version number of 11.246.


Included Routines
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 See the source for descriptions of the included routines.

 OS installation is not supported, and probably never will be.
 Self-testing is not supported, and probably never will be.
 Battery+Del/Stat/Mode are thus not supported either.
